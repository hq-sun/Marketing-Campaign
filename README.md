# Marketing Campaign Project
The response.csv file contains observations taken from a recent direct marketing campaign to win back former customers. 

The goal of this project is to:

1. Develop a predictive model to be used to select records to be included in a future campaign.

2.	Apply the model to a new dataset and select records to meet the marketing teams' cost per sale goals.
3.	Design a simple ab comparison test to understand performance differences attributable to variation in marketing treatment.
